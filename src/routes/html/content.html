<p>Last week I turned 40, and to celebrate, here are 40 of my favorite things üëá</p>
<p><em>In no particular order, but mildly categorized...</em></p>
<h2>Kitchen</h2>
<h3>1 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3FL9ay6" target="_blank">Waffle Fry slicer</a></h3>
<p>There&#39;s no better way to make potatoes at home. This creates great thick waffle fries, which we use in the air fryer. Don&#39;t forget to soak in water for 30 mins, then dry, then cook! (removes starch).</p>
<h3>2 - Scrubdaddy</h3>
<p>Try the Scrubmommy. Try the Grilldaddy. The entire lineup of brushes/sponges is LEGIT and I&#39;m made at myself for not discovering them sooner. DON&#39;T BUY THEM ON AMAZON (they&#39;re fake half the time!!)</p>
<h3>3 - <a href="https://ippodotea.com/collections/matcha" target="_blank">Ippodo Matcha</a> Tea Powder</h3>
<p>Cheap pre-packaged matcha tea = meh. Tastes like grass. World-class matcha = SO GOOD. Tastes like expensive, smooth grass.</p>
<h3>4 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3EccHor" target="_blank">Hario V60</a> coffee dripper</h3>
<p>As a coffee fanatic, this is the best pourover dripper I&#39;ve found. Make sure to get the plastic one! (heats up the fastest/easiest, which is important)</p>
<h3>5 - <a href="https://amzn.to/4jdzE9N" target="_blank">Cheap knife sharpening stones</a></h3>
<p>As somebody who cooks a fair bit and has nicer knives, some whetstones are a must. This $25ish kit is SO much better than those little V-shaped sharpeners.</p>
<h2>Everyday Carry (EDC)</h2>
<h3>6 - <a href="https://fieldnotesbrand.com/" target="_blank">Field Notes</a></h3>
<p>I tried the bigger, expensive notebooks, and found I never wrote in them. Field Notes are smaller, cheaper, but they can ALSO be collected, which is super fun. I&#39;m rocking <a href="https://www.draplin.com/merch/paper-goods/ddc-054-ddc-fn-turquoise-tribute-can-mex" target="_blank">the limited edition Turquoise</a> from Draplin right now.</p>
<h3>7 - <a href="https://nahvalur.com/collections/nahvalur-nautilus?srsltid=AfmBOooCkV_cgYF71ymPh5KK7qLqSHYR2Px_6t570-saYKhJWnqQTvTG" target="_blank">Nahvalur Nautilus</a> fountain pen</h3>
<p>I thought I was going to dive deep down the fountain pen rabbit hole--but then I found 2-3 pens that were just <em>perfect,</em> and I stopped. The Nahvalur (it means Narwhal) Nautilus IS SO CLEAN and amazing to hold and write with. I got the Cephalopod Black.</p>
<h3>8 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3EfBMii" target="_blank">Muji Gel Pen</a> 0.38mm</h3>
<p>The best feeling &quot;cheap&quot; pen I&#39;ve found. Made in Japan.</p>
<h3>9 - <a href="https://hitchandtimber.com/" target="_blank">Hitch &amp; Timber Pouch</a></h3>
<p>The Field Notes, pens, etc, live in this hand-made pouch. It screams <em>&quot;Look at me, I&#39;m a tactical dude&quot;</em>... Even if you&#39;re a nerd like me.</p>
<h3>10 - <a href="https://amzn.to/4chqy9Q" target="_blank">Olight Baton 4</a> (flashlight)</h3>
<p>Every human should own at least one GOOD flashlight, and this is mine. It&#39;s tiny with a charging case, (which charges the battery 5 times), and has INCREDIBLE functionality built into ONE button. Gets insanely bright. They routinely go on sale!</p>
<h2>Audio</h2>
<h3>11 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3YdlX2p" target="_blank">PreSonus Eris</a> (desk monitors)</h3>
<p>Speakers = built to sound good. Monitors = built to sound accurate. But <em>mostly</em> the same thing, and these are FANTASTIC for near-field listening (i.e. sitting on your desk). I have the 3.5&quot; version (size of the woofer). They&#39;re &quot;active,&quot; aka you don&#39;t need an amp. Just plug stuff in and listen to incredible sound.</p>
<h3>12 - Apple Airpods Pro 2</h3>
<p>I have hearing damage, and need hearing aids (damn you, drumline years). I tested &quot;real&quot; hearing aids--<a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/hearing-health/?afid=p238%7CsMHNNMRk1-dc_mtid_5iuwnp2za0_pcrid_737250436469_pgrid_165917096606_pexid__ptid_kwd-472368132867_&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-wearables-slid---productid--NonCore-AirPodsPro-Q225Avail" target="_blank">AND the new hearing aid functionality from the Airpods</a>, and I prefer the Airpods. Plus they&#39;re just great earbuds, of course.</p>
<h3>13 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3XFv2kz" target="_blank">Wiim Mini</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/42c4Mzr" target="_blank">Wiim Pro</a> (streamer)</h3>
<p>If you wanted to get into <em>budget</em> hifi, you&#39;d buy 3 things: used speakers, a used amp, and a streamer. Think of these as &quot;connects bluetooth audio streaming to amps/dacs/speakers/etc that don&#39;t have Bluetooth.&quot; The Wiim Pro also has a built-in DAC and way more inputs!!</p>
<h2>Health &amp; Fitness</h2>
<h3>14 - <a href="https://www.goruck.com/collections/sandbags" target="_blank">GoRuck Sandbags</a></h3>
<p>There is something super primal about sandbag training, and I absolutely LOVE these things. Great for mobility &amp; strength training. I have a 15lb and 60lb (pay extra for the v2 sandbags, they have way more handles).</p>
<h3>15 - <a href="https://www.fridaypickle.com/PETE60935" target="_blank">Friday Pickleball Paddles</a></h3>
<p>This my beginner paddle recommendation. They come 2 for $100, which is PERFECT for trying to convince your spouse to learn to play with you üëçü•í</p>
<h3>16 - <a href="https://amzn.to/4lrI4MO" target="_blank">Under-desk treadmill</a></h3>
<p>Standing desk + treadmill = burning calories while you work. SO GOOD. $99 is a stupid good price for what this will do for your life. That link is the exact one I have.</p>
<h2>Wear it</h2>
<h3>17 - <a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/" target="_blank">Barefoot shoes</a> (Vivobarefoot Primus Lite)</h3>
<p>Once you start using barefoot shoes--it&#39;s hard to go back. Literally. Your feet &amp; shoes literally change shape (and get way, way stronger). I have the Primus Lite for everyday use. I&#39;m going to buy barefoot boots next winter. <a href="https://xeroshoes.com/" target="_blank">Xero</a> is another good barefoot brand.</p>
<h3>18 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3DSdmeS" target="_blank">Under Armour Tech</a> shirt</h3>
<p>Why did nobody tell me how good Under Armour is?! After years of buying the cheapest &quot;exercise shirts&quot; ever, I recently got a UA &quot;tech&quot; shirt, and I&#39;ve been blown away. They have several different styles in the tech series.</p>
<h3>19 - <a href="https://vuoriclothing.com/collections/joggers" target="_blank">Vuori sweatpants</a></h3>
<p>Yes, they&#39;re really worth the hype. I got the Ponto Performance Jogger, and I wear it every. single. day. No shame. JOIN THEIR EMAIL LIST for a coupon (if you&#39;re already on their list, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=temporary+email&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS746US746&oq=temporary+email&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDAgAEEUYORixAxiABDINCAEQABiDARixAxiABDINCAIQABiDARixAxiABDIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDE5MjZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">get a temporary email</a>.)</p>
<h2>Shed + Truck</h2>
<h3>20 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3E4Qt7R" target="_blank">Seat Covers</a> (Rough Country) &amp; <a href="https://amzn.to/4cmjuZE" target="_blank">Husky Floor Mats</a></h3>
<p>I&#39;ll group these. This is the first vehicle I have ever purchased floor mats (heavy-duty rubber) and seat covers (functional neoprene, not fashion) for--and I&#39;ll NEVER have another vehicle without these. </p>
<h3>21 - <a href="https://www.yeti.com/coolers/hard-coolers?prefn1=collection&prefv1=Tundra" target="_blank">Yeti Cooler</a></h3>
<p>This is another one of those &quot;does a cooler really need to cost that much&quot; items, but the answer is yes. Yeti coolers are just so good. I started with a Tundra 65, which was too big/heavy. I downgraded to the Tundra 45 in Georgia Bulldog red.</p>
<h3>22 - <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Suncast-Java-134-Gal-Plastic-Wicker-Deck-Box-BMDB134004/203014102" target="_blank">Cheap &quot;deck box&quot; storage</a></h3>
<p>Our outdoor storage is kinda small, and I like my shed space! I went to Home Depot and bought the biggest wicker storage box I could (130L or so). Loved it so much I bought another one 6 months later.</p>
<h2>Desk</h2>
<h3>23 - DIY NAS + <a href="https://unraid.net/?srsltid=AfmBOoqpD3HZsGV_swij4WypYveROrABQlR3hcwC9yC5vtLebRaQQJYv" target="_blank">Unraid</a></h3>
<p>NAS = &quot;Network Attached Storage&quot; aka my own little server--complete with üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èPlexüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è (Google it), and &quot;cloud storage.&quot; I&#39;m using Unraid (software) to run it, and although it&#39;s DEFINITELY been a learning experience (highly techy!), it&#39;s worth it! <a href="https://blog.briancmoses.com/2024/09/diy-nas-2024-edition-and-econonas.html?r=current-nas" target="_blank">I followed this guide</a> and bought the cheapest components possible from Aliexpress.</p>
<h3>24 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3E0ZAGO" target="_blank">DJI Wireless Lav Microphones</a></h3>
<p>I&#39;ve sold most of my microphones, and just keep the ATR2100, Rode NTG4 (permanent fixture in my office), and the DJI mics. These little beauties JUST WORK. Highly portable, case-charging, sound great, and work with phone, laptop, and DSLR. SO GOOD. I have the older version (Mic, not Mic 2).</p>
<h3>25 - <a href="https://nuphy.com/products/halo65?sca_ref=3853359.f2q1o8ZZoh" target="_blank">NuPhy Halo65</a> Mechanical Keyboard</h3>
<p>At this point, companies straight-up mail me their keyboards, so I have 40-50. The NuPhy keyboards are <em>the best pre-built</em> keyboards on the market. I have 6 NuPhy&#39;s, and they&#39;re all great, but I prefer the 65% layout.</p>
<h3>26 - Kailh &quot;<a href="https://amzn.to/4jikH6s" target="_blank">Deep-Sea</a>&quot; &amp; &quot;<a href="https://amzn.to/3Jpl1jR" target="_blank">Box Jade</a>&quot; switches</h3>
<p>One of the best things about <em>mechanical</em> keyboards is that you can swap out the &quot;switches.&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB309x2bU4s&t=17s" target="_blank">See this video.</a> I&#39;ve tried dozens of switches. If you really want a QUIET keyboard, go with the Kailh &quot;Deep Sea&quot; switches (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4tgNGfvlUM" target="_blank">sound test</a>). If you like loud (clicky) switches, the Box Jades are my fave. (<a href="https://youtu.be/adGUVsy5ypw?si=KdlEcQ2LAEAarLrk" target="_blank">sound test</a>)</p>
<h3>27 - <a href="https://amzn.to/4j3fCPq" target="_blank">Kindle Paperwhite</a></h3>
<p>I do love holding an actual book--but I bought this when I was going through a 14-book series where the paperbacks wouldn&#39;t open all the way--and they were uncomfortable to hold. Now I use it every single day, and the battery lasts months. BUY THIS REFURBISHED! I got mine for HALF the price and it&#39;s been perfect.</p>
<h3>28 - <a href="https://novelkeys.com/collections/deskpads?srsltid=AfmBOopCjmAssygJCA5Dg_7Q8LWDHge4MFIOZakIupY8rff6Yd3b9wrZ" target="_blank">Novelkeys Desk mats</a></h3>
<p>If you work at a desk, you need a desk mat. I have a few cheap FELT mats from Amazon, and they&#39;re great. But I also have a NASA-themed mat from Novelkeys which feels fantastic.</p>
<h2>Bed &amp; Bath</h2>
<h3>29 - <a href="https://amzn.to/4iUTabs" target="_blank">Cheap Shower Caddy</a></h3>
<p>Keeping shower stuff on the bathtub ledges always drives me crazy. This cheap set on Amazon sticks super well and works great.</p>
<h3>30 - <a href="https://www.getquip.com/products/blue-metal-360-oscillating-toothbrush?srsltid=AfmBOopCd7tD7oaxBkRjh-FRxfnDArc11ANiplOP0WjxwMzC-R-NvR13" target="_blank">Quip Toothbrush</a></h3>
<p>I used one of the cheaper electric toothbrushes from Quip for 3 years, and it was great. But the newer oscillating version is way better, and still pretty affordable. The Quip brushes are SO much easier to clean that other brands.</p>
<h3>31 - <a href="https://amzn.to/3FPAoU1" target="_blank">Cheap sunrise alarm clock</a></h3>
<p>Wake up with light (that gets steadier brighter over 15 mins). Can play white noise as well. FULLY dimmable display is a great feature, though the initial light was just 25% softer haha.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<h3>32 - <a href="https://betterdictation.com/" target="_blank">Better Dictation</a></h3>
<p>Voice-to-text with a hotkey. Super accurate and a breeze to set up, and it&#39;s a one-time payment(!)</p>
<h3>33 - <a href="https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper" target="_blank">MacWhisper</a></h3>
<p>A more robust audio-to-text AI app, which recently added multi-speaker detection (making it great for podcasts, coaching calls, etc). I recently upgraded to Pro for that (one-time $50ish payment is amazing!). I&#39;m pretty sure this has voice-to-text as well, so I could replace Better Dictation.</p>
<h3>34 - <a href="https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/" target="_blank">Keyboard Maestro</a></h3>
<p>Text expansions (with variables and other fancy automations), macros, and hotkey stuff. I think I use this 10x an hour when I&#39;m working. On my Windows computer, I use Autohotkey. (which AI can help you code btw!!)</p>
<h3>35 - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scratchpad/id6504040051" target="_blank">Scratchpad</a></h3>
<p>&quot;Sticky note software&quot; that pops up with a hotkey, and stays on top of other apps. Handy for quick notes (but has a ton of other advanced customization options, save-to-file, and more).</p>
<h3>36 - <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> (for notes)</h3>
<p>Broke = Notion. Woke = Obsidian. It&#39;s 10x more customizable and faster. It&#39;s offline-first and privacy-first, and saves all files in simple Markdown (making it easy to take with you). I save all my files to iCloud so I can sync between mobile/desktop, etc. WARNING: if you don&#39;t like Rabbit holes, stick to Notion, Capacities, Craft.do, One Note, or Apple Notes. I wrote this blog post / email in Obsidian!</p>
<h3>37 - ChatGPT Plus</h3>
<p>Claude and Gemini are still great whenever I use them--but at this point I have a lot of custom GPTs and chat histories that I want access to. I might drop down to the free version again, though.</p>
<h3>38 - <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> (coding IDE)</h3>
<p>My code editor of choice. Their AI agent has been the best I&#39;ve tried, and they keep add improvements every week. IT&#39;S NUTS.</p>
<h3>39 - <a href="http://auphonic.com/" target="_blank">Auphonic</a></h3>
<p>I upload raw podcast audio, and it automatically adds intros and outros, remove silences, reduces background noise, adds compression, levels the audio, AND transcribes with AI models. EVERYTHING. And it&#39;s dirt cheap.</p>
<h3>40 - <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/" target="_blank">Buzzsprout</a></h3>
<p>Podcast hosting service of choice. I use them because I&#39;ve been using them. I should probably look into free options again, as this is $18/mo.</p>
