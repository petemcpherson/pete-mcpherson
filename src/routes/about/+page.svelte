			I never really knew what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wanted to be everything! <i
				>How could one person choose to just do one thing all of their life?</i
			>
		</p>

		<p>So I struggled.</p>
		<p>
			I was good at a lot of things and chose to pursue music until I realized I didn't actually
			want to do it as a living. Three years into my college degree, no less...
		</p>
		<p>
			I was told by my parents, teachers, counselors, and just about everybody else that all I
			needed in life was to "get a job."
		</p>
		<p>
			So after finally graduating with a degree in sociology from the University of Georgia, I
			decided to go a completely different route and get my master's in accounting so I could be a
			highly paid accountant.
		</p>
		<p>Fun, right?</p>
		<p><i>Right?!</i></p>
		<p>
			I graduated, got a full-time adult job, passed my CPA exam, and got my CPA license, and I
			<span class="text-error">HATED</span> basically every second of it for a couple of years.
		</p>
		<h2>So I quit.</h2>
		<p>
			I decided to leave a really fantastic career and pursue a job at a startup that would allow me
			to develop my entrepreneurial muscle.
		</p>
		<p>
			After selling our house and moving across the state, my family of three and a half (my wife
			was expecting our 2nd child)...I started my job...
		</p>
		<p>...and got laid off after <span class="text-success">one paycheck.</span></p>
		<p>womp womp.</p>
		<h2>
			So I reached out and spoke to some Creator friends who were making more than six figures a
			year...
		</h2>
		<p>I asked them tons of questions. I wanted to know HOW.</p>
		<p>
			Thankfully, I was smart enough to record and publish these sessions, and the (award-winning)
			Do You Even Blog Podcast was born.
		</p>
		<p>That was May of 2017, and I've been going strong ever since ;)</p>
		<h2>Now, I'm a generalist.</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I've given keynote speaches</li>
			<li>I've built 4 apps in the past year, which have grossed $50k. I'm not a developer.</li>
			<li>The DYEB podcast has over 2M downloads (and I have another podcast as well)</li>
			<li>I have 3 YouTube channels</li>
			<li>I own a portfolio of smaller websites (i.e. blogs)</li>
			<li>
				I've worked with dozens of well-known brands, creating cool content and building helpful
				thingsÂ (mostly in the digital marketing space)
			</li>
			<li>and more.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>My 'Purpose'</h2>
		<p>Might seem corny, but this is actually surprisingly easy for me.</p>
		<p>
			<mark>I aim to make the internet better. I want to make it more fun and interesting.</mark>
		</p>
		<p>
			These days I am mostly focused on growing my weekly roundup newsletter where I share
			interesting finds and cool tools from around the internet.
		</p>
		<p>and building apps.</p>
		<p>
			Web apps, mobile apps, you name it. I have an idea list a mile long and I am looking to see
			just how many useful and fun tools I can ship for people.
		</p>
